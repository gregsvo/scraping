Special independent projects and studies to support or refute new concepts and ideas\n3.

Coordinating the business owner's calendar, tasks and commitments, helping to keep him focused on rapidly changing priorities. \n7.  Partnering with other staff members and associates to resolve challenges as necessary. \n8.  Typing correspondence, formatting spreadsheets and presentations. \n9.  Performing other administrative tasks as necessary.  \n\nDesired attributes for probable success include:\n\nA.  Comfortable with a peer to peer working relationship.

Since opening our doors in 2016, our prime location has resulted in a significant number of new relationships (walk-in customers)!\n\nCommission vs. Booth Renting\n\nYour success as a Beauty Professional or Barber depends a lot on your environment.  You want to practice your craft in a supportive environment that you enjoy, where you feel good about yourself, and where you can maximize your income.  This generally means either working for commission or renting a booth/chair.  \n\nAn increasingly popular method of working in a salon is renting a booth or chair, also called \"booth-renting\".  While salons that booth rent can be difficult to find (a result of the fact that the salon owner makes significantly less income than a traditional salon owner), they are extremely lucrative to the Stylist.  Renting a chair in a salon involves paying \"rent\" to the owner of the salon. It's no different than renting an apartment in an apartment building.  In this case, the salon owner leases out workstations to independent stylists in exchange for a monthly rent.  The rent is usually not more than the income you will earn from one or two services you perform that week.  That's right....for the cost of just one or two services per week, you can essentially run your own business and reap the rewards.  You get flexibility when scheduling your clients (you generally get a key to the salon and can schedule your clients whenever is convenient to you), and you also get to keep not only 100% of your income, but also 100% of any products you sell!!!!\n\nThe Pros of Booth Renting over working at a Commission-based Salon:\n\n\u2022  ***You are your own boss***. Your schedule accommodates you - not the salon manager.\n\u2022  ***You can charge whatever you like for the services you are providing***.\n\u2022  After paying your salon rental fee, all the money you earn is yours...including all income from product sales.\n\nGenerally, the only regret a booth-renting Stylist has is that they didn't make the move sooner!  The experienced cosmetologist with any type of client base will substantially increase his/her net income, while doing it on their own schedule.  It's a lot easier to change salons and run your own book of business if you have a list of clients who will follow you and keep you afloat.  Just make sure you aren't relocating too far from your existing salon....Anything less than 10 miles is usually the rule of thumb. \n\nCheck us out online.  If you aren't convinced a booth rental scenario is right for you, reach out to one of our Stylists or Barbers that have recently made the change.  They are likely more than happy to give their wisdom on how the decision was the best decision they ever made!  \n\ntracy & co barber salon\n440 773-2223\nwww.tracyandcohair.com", "Compensation": "100% up to you :)", "Employement Type": "employee's choice"},

If hired in our Primary Hiring Area, you can expect to get home weekly. However, you can also expect to spend two consecutive weeks away from the house about 4-6 times in a year. Our Extended Hiring Area offers routes that get you home about every other week. After running two weeks out, you can expect solid home time with 48 hours minimum. Also, you choose the arrival day - Friday or Saturday - and we'll make it happen.   We believe that the best drivers on the road deserve a smarter pay scale that gets them the most money for their mileage. We pay by practical miles rather than short miles and we bring it when it comes to accessorial pay and bonuses. We've been recognized as a Top Pay Carrier for offering a compensation package that ranks in the top 20% of the industry. Beyond great pay, we make sure our drivers get top-of-the-line equipment, high-tech maintenance, and new-model trucks.

We are in the business of purchasing real estate in the Cleveland area. \n\nWhat's SPECIFICALLY needed from you..\n\n(1) You MUST be a self-starter. This is a small organization that does a GREAT deal of business. There are AWESOME systems in place but you'll be figuring a bit out on your own. \n\n(2) You need to be TOTALLY comfortable with simple internet-based programs. Familiarity with Google (even google apps), online databases, etc. Also have an above-average grasp of Social Media (facebook, twitter, the like - PLEASE know what these are if applying )\n\n(3) Our inbound calls from potential sellers has increased and need a great person to enhance our business. You will NOT be cold calling. Calls are generated to us from our various marketing campaigns and we need assistance taking their calls and turning them into qualified leads.\n\nCandidates must possess the following skills:\n\u2022 Great Team Player\n\u2022 Ability to make 70 calls a day\n\u2022 Must be organized\n\u2022 Able to negotiate\n\u2022 Must be upbeat and great nature\n\u2022 Must have eloquent phone abilities\n\u2022 Must be self-driven\n\u2022 Must possess basic knowledge of Microsoft programs\n\u2022 Ability to work well with others\n\n(4) Be COMFORTABLE doing a small amount of PERSONAL ASSISTING. Since you'll be working DIRECTLY with me, at times I will need a few errands run. Pick up dry-cleaning, drop off FedEx, arrange for when the housekeeper comes by, etc.\n\n(5) You'll be working out of a collaborative, open office environment with people who hustle and get things done. Think tech startup style energy and productivity.\n\nOK - the COOL thing is that this is a pretty laid-back job where you get to interact with a lot of cool people. The WORK part of it is that sometimes there are DEADLINES and CRUNCHES and the schedule is intense then more laid back.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO NEXT.\n\nJust to set your expectation, the last time I posted a job here I received over 300 applications and called TWO people back. I hired one of them immediately. So I will NOT be responding to all applications. Here's what I am looking for (see, this really CAN be easy!)\n\n(1) Tell me how you will fit in THIS job! I've laid out as clearly as I can the job requirements. I know what I'm looking for and have made them a fit. I will NOT be calling you to clarify whether or not you're a fit. So there's no second chance - your response IS your impression!\n\n(2) Tell me your income expectations (or a range). We'll be working together and I will be communicating VERY specific communications to you in the future. Being vague in this area just sets up a concern that you're not going to be able to ask for what you really want later if you come on board.\n\n(3) Describe for me your ideal working environment. Hours, flexibility or structure, casual or formal. I'm kinda open to a number of options and inflexible on a few areas, but I want to know what works for you. I'm looking for the IDEAL fit, not to go through TRIAL runs...\n\n(4) I'm glad to see your resume, but without an accompanying document (letter, rant, attachment, etc.) addressing the above, I can assure you that it will be a waste of your time.\n\nIF YOU'VE READ THIS FAR!!!!\n...brave soul!\n\nCongratulations - you're possibly a fit for this pretty cool job. I love what I do and I'm looking for ONE person to help manage some things going forward. I'm much tamer than I sound but I do have very specific requirements which I communicate clearly then empower you to have the authority to enforce! You'll get to work with some quite renowned people (my clients) but the coolest part is our focus here on really improving our overall lives so a lot of focus and support will be given to that!\n\nGet those responses over as soon as you can so the RIGHT one of you can start working right away.

{"URL": "https://cleveland.craigslist.org/wri/d/academic-consulting-firm/6345617738.html", "Title": "Academic Consulting Firm Recruiting new Analysts and Editors", "Address": "", "Description": "1.) Who we are:\nWe are a medium sized, cloud-based consultancy headquartered in Delaware, USA, but with consultants spread across the globe, from Asia to South America. We primarily handle Academic Consulting for Doctorate level clients, and are currently hiring for 3 positions: Qualitative Analyst, Quantitative Analyst, and Editor.\nEach position is a strictly work-from-home position, and any applicant should view this as a strong incentive. Please note that hours for these positions are flexible, from part-time (10 hours per week) up to full-time (50-60 hours per week) depending on your schedule and preferences.\nAll applicants will be required to attempt a trial project which varies depending on the position they are applying for. All applicants to the SAME position will receive the SAME trial project - successful applicants will be paid for the trial project, but unsucessful applicants will NOT be paid. Please note for the trial project, and for all final deliverables, MS Word will be required.\n\n2a.) Job responsibilities for the Qualitative Analyst position:\nYour main responsibility will be to support our clients in their dissertation processes. This may include:\n\nContent changes - Making changes to pre-existing work based on the comments of the client's dissertation committee.\n\nTopic selection - Finding research gaps in academic literature, creating a valid problem statement, justifying the purpose for the study, and selecting an underlying Theoretical or Conceptual Framework\nto guide the study. \n\nExpansions - Taking a preliminary piece of the client's work, and expanding it into complete chapters.\n\nMethodological Development - Choosing the optimal qualitative methodology to use for a particular study, such as Grounded Theory, Content Analysis, or Phenomenology.\n\nQualitative Analysis - Coding qualitative data such as interviews or focus group transcripts, conducting the analysis using qualitative analysis software, and interpreting the results.\n\nLiterature Reviews - Finding and reviewing relevant recent literature, creating an outline and Annotated Bibliography for a literature review, and drafting the review based on the articles and outline.\n\nMulti-part Projects - projects that involve elements of all of the above, and/or involve assisting our clients in correcting errors made in the above areas of their dissertation.\n\nThere will be substantial 'on the job learning' as you're slowly introduced to (and trained on) each of the above project types, one-by-one. It is very important for all applicants to the qualitative analyst position to be comfortable with researching academic literature via online databases such as Google Scholar or ERIC. This particular requirement is extremely important, perhaps even more so than the other requirements.\n\n2b.) Job responsibilities for the Quantitative Analyst position:\nYour main responsibility will be to support our clients in the statistical phases of their dissertation processes. \n\nImportantly, you will need to be comfortable designing and drafting a valid statistical methodology \n(specifying the sample, population, instruments, data collection and analysis procedures, etc.), \nrunning the analyses using standard stats packages, and drafting and interpreting the results. \n\nAll deliverables need to be in a presentable, professional format, and should adhere to APA guidelines when applicable. Applicants must have a strong applied mathematics or statistics background; proficiency in applied statistics and hypothesis testing required.\n\nAdditionally, applicants must be familiar with common statistical software packages such as SPSS, R or Stata. As a bonus, applicants experienced in SEM and Path Analysis software like AMOS or MPLUS will receive higher pay for those project types.\n\nFinally, all applicants must be extremely comfortable writing, as this is a big part of the position, not just statistical analysis and expertise, but academic writing.\n\n2c.) Job responsibilities for the Editor position:\nYour main responsibility will be to edit documents ranging from 25-200 pages, virtually all in APA 6 format, for both internal use and directly for clients. Almost all the documents will be academic papers (primarily dissertations), and familiarity with the dissertation formatting guidelines is required. \n\nApplicants must have a strong background in editing - we are not training editors: all editors should apply ready to immediately begin work. Applicants should be familiar with all functions of MS Word, and specifically be very comfortable with APA 6 formatting guidelines as applicable to documents in MS Word format. Additionally, applicants should be fully knowledgeable of all the major formatting guidelines of a standard doctorate level dissertation, including headings, front matter, references, etc.\n\n3.) Requirements:\nApplicants must possess a meticulous nature and an extremely high attention to detail.\n\nExcellent command of the English Language.\n\nBachelor's Degree or higher, preferably from a good American university. However, most of our analysts have graduate degrees.\n\n4.) Compensation:\na.) Qualitative Analyst fees vary by project type and complexity. Typically, it ranges from $200-$600 per project depending on length, difficulty, and timeline. Most of our analysts make between $1000-$2000 monthly on limited, flexible hours. However, several full-time analysts make substantially more, depending on how quickly and efficiently they can do the work, as well as their experience and seniority at the firm.\n\nb.) Quantitative Analyst fees vary depending on whether the work is primarily done in SPSS, or if it requires other software like SAS, STATA, R, AMOS, MPLUS etc. In the former case, fees range from $100-$300, and in the latter case, fees range from $300-$900. More advanced software is typically required if the project is large and/or complex, requiring more sophisticated statistical methodologies. We do not provide any of the software, and all applicants must have access to their own software to be considered.\n\nc.) Pay for editors is $1/page for 'internal' work done on company documents, and $1.5/page for 'external' work done on client documents. A typical edit will be between 25-200 pages, and will pay $1.5/page assuming it is being done for a client.\n\n5.) To Apply:\nPlease reply with a recently updated resume, and a cover letter or email explaining your interest in the specified position: Qualitative Analyst, Quantitative Analyst, or Editor.", "Compensation": "Please refer to the compensation section of the job ad", "Employement Type": "contract"},

Our mission is to conveniently deliver high quality content for our global client base and our writers are an integral part of that process. \n\nWorking at Ultius will not only sharpen your writing and editing skills, but it will also allow you to take part in a fast-growing company that is focused on writer success. Thousands of professionals from around the country enjoy the autonomous and lucrative nature of the job. Join the company that values your unique capabilities as a writer and editor. \n\nMost of our core management team started out in the writing position which has resulted in a freelance ecosystem that offers fair and transparent terms. It's no surprise that many of our writers utilize our platform as a primary source of income.\n\nJOB DESCRIPTION\nWe are currently looking for talented freelance writers who are strong in the academic style. Unlike other writing services, there is no bidding and we never force you to take an order. We provide login credentials to our website, ultius(dot)com, where you can view orders, track compensation, communicate with clients and editors on existing orders, utilize our help section, and much more. We are continually updating our site with additional material and information to assist our writers. The most important professional qualities for success as an Ultius writer are careful adherence to deadlines and close attention to order instructions. You can view the full order requirements before you claim each order, which allows you to determine whether or not you can meet the order's expectations.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\nThe preferred candidate will have at least a 4 year degree from an accredited, American based college or university or be in active pursuit of such a degree.

We also promote from within and take writer's experiences with us very seriously.

You may also respond to this job post. Be sure to send your resume or CV and a cover letter. Pending review of your initial resume and application, you will be asked to write a sample paper in order to demonstrate your writing skills. In the world of online writing, a sample paper is used in lieu of an in-person interview. The sample paper is used only to gauge your writing ability. It does not get sold, published, or viewed by any party besides the hiring personnel.\n\nCOMPENSATION\nWe have a sliding pay scale that generally runs from $7.50-22 per page. The regular freelance queue pays $7.50-13 per page, the urgency queue pays $12-19 per page, and the graduate level queue pays $11-22 per page. Applicable order bonuses are in addition to these payout ranges. Payouts are automatically set by our ordering system when the customer creates their order.

This will cover the entire network's wide variety of support and service's you'll receive to become a successful home inspector with our company.\n\nCompany Benefits:\n\n- Home Inspector Training and Certification\n- E&O Insurance\n- Marketing Training\n- Home Inspection Checklist to complete your work orders\n- National recognized Inspection company (branding)\n- Daily training and back office support\n- Free company business cards\n- A personal business listing on Google Maps\n- Company website to promote your business\n\nPlease respond directly to this posting and we'll be in touch with more information and instructions on the the next step of the hiring process.
