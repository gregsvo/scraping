About Bulk Transit:
We are family-owned and operated since 1972. Our founder was a Truck Driver who still comes to the office every day. We began transporting dry bulk freight from our Ohio headquarters. Since then we have added two sister offices in New York and Texas, and more than 10 operation centers throughout Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and New York from which to service our customers.
We still provide the same culture our founder installed many years ago. We deliver an outstanding work-life balance that attracts dedicated employees to Bulk Transit, and for the same reason they are staying for a long-lasting career. Our strength is in our size: We are small enough to react quickly to customer needs, yet big enough to have the financial backing that those needs may require. We are the best of both worlds: ""not too big and not too small.""

I am looking for a motivated field underwriter in the Cleveland area.  He/She must be passionate about improving their situation and also be passionate about helping others.  I am looking for a team player, yet a strong leader.  Someone who is willing to learn and apply new skills for this sales opportunity.

Each week we mail thousands of letters to people who just bought or refinanced a home in your area. Our letter clearly states that the client may qualify for a non-medical, mortgage protection product. We will pay off the mortgage in the event of their death or even make the mortgage payments in case of a disability or critical illness.  And at the end of the term they will receive all of their money back! 

Clients interested in our product will personally fill out our questionnaire and then mail it back to us.  

So, we need an individual who will take the letters we receive, call the homeowner to set up an appointment, and then go sit down with them at their home for about 45 minutes in order to help them pick out the best mortgage protection plan that fits their budget. 

Absolutely, no cold-calling! 

Typically, commission is about $450.00 per family you protect. Yes, it is full commission, but our average full-time underwriter will sell 5 to 7 mortgage protection plans a week.  You will always be sitting in front of interest, qualified buyers!  

Additionally, Fixed Indexed Annuities and Indexed Universal Life Policies are available for clients wanting to protect and grow their retirement savings.  Our training is comprehensive and you will be mentored every step of the way.  

I'm also looking for that special person who may want to build their own agency.  If you are willing to devote yourself to developing the leadership skills necessary as a manager, your income potential for this position is unlimited. Many of our managers have a passive income and will have it for life.  

You will need a state life insurance license or be willing to acquire one.  This should normally take you about two weeks.

If you meet the above requirements, please call me.  Be prepared to tell me about yourself and, more importantly, what is it about this position that interests you most.  I look forward to speaking with you.  

Please do not send a resume.  

Please do not send a text.

About Bulk Transit:
We are family-owned and operated since 1972. Our founder was a Truck Driver who still comes to the office every day. We began transporting dry bulk freight from our Ohio headquarters. Since then we have added two sister offices in New York and Texas, and more than 10 operation centers throughout Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and New York from which to service our customers.
We still provide the same culture our founder installed many years ago. We deliver an outstanding work-life balance that attracts dedicated employees to Bulk Transit, and for the same reason they are staying for a long-lasting career. Our strength is in our size: We are small enough to react quickly to customer needs, yet big enough to have the financial backing that those needs may require. We are the best of both worlds: ""not too big and not too small.""

We are looking for hardcore CLOSERS. We have a serious amount of people that have requested our services (100% NO COLD CALLING), and just need local help, to go and closeout the deal.

Our agents that work about 25 hours a week, conservatively net around $104,000.



Simply said:

We teach people to make six figures by working part time, selling mortgage protection. This product is a form of life insurance that will pay off a new homeowners loan, in the case of death, illness, or disability (you must hold a license or be willing to get one. Normally takes 1 week to complete).



How we do it:

Call and set appointments on the leads 6-8 hours a week. Set up 12-15 appointments. Do 10 presentations (you'll get 2-5 reschedules per week). Close 5 deals (average person has 50% closing ratio).



How the Money works:

You make an average of $500 per sale. 5 sales will equal $2,500 per week. You would be a 1099 worker, so we will teach you to manage your money, as well. After expenses like gas for your car and leads, etc, you should net at least 80-90% of whatever you make (conservatively $2,000 per week which equals $104,000 per year net).

Yes, being self employed you'll have to smart with budgeting, and we don't apologize for that. Our leads are extremely effective and valuable, but we teach you to run a REAL BUSINESS. We aren't looking for the 9-5'ers that want to make 30-40k per year, and have everything spoon-fed to them. We want the aggressive closers, that have been dreaming of a very SIMPLE way to generate 100k+, closing deals a few days per week.



How the Leads works:

You are calling real people that have filled out a form, requesting insurance. THEY KNOW that they are filling out a request to BUY INSURANCE. Attached to this ad, is EXACTLY what we mail out every single week to new homeowners. Also, the attached picture of the state, shows you just how many LEFTOVER clients we have for the week, that filled out a form asking for coverage, and they have never received a call from us, simply because WE NEED MORE AGENTS.



Six Figure Sales Schedule:

We teach people to take 2, four-hour sessions of setting appointments (from home). And 2 full days of running appointments (in the client's home). You choose which county or counties you desire to work. That's it.



Don't have 25 hours a week to work?:

We'll look at what time you have available, and give you a realistic amount that you could make, if you hustle.



Am I capped out at 100k?

Definitely not. We teach people that you could make much more than that, but the smartest way to do it, is to hire and train others in the other 2 days you have availability in the week. Insurance companies pay MAJOR BONUSES to managers. And you don't have to stop selling while you do it. The average managers in our business makes $200,000+.

https://cleveland.craigslist.org/bus/d/makeworking-25-hours-week/6341000474.html,"MAKE $104,000 working 25 hours/week (Multiple Locations)",Cleveland,"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE AD BEFORE APPLYING. Thank you.

We are looking for hardcore CLOSERS. We have a serious amount of people that have requested our services (100% NO COLD CALLING), and just need local help, to go and closeout the deal.

Our agents that work about 25 hours a week, conservatively net around $104,000.



Simply said:

We teach people to make six figures by working part time, selling mortgage protection. This product is a form of life insurance that will pay off a new homeowners loan, in the case of death, illness, or disability (you must hold a license or be willing to get one. Normally takes 1 week to complete).



How we do it:

Call and set appointments on the leads 6-8 hours a week. Set up 12-15 appointments. Do 10 presentations (you'll get 2-5 reschedules per week). Close 5 deals (average person has 50% closing ratio).



How the Money works:

You make an average of $500 per sale. 5 sales will equal $2,500 per week. You would be a 1099 worker, so we will teach you to manage your money, as well. After expenses like gas for your car and leads, etc, you should net at least 80-90% of whatever you make (conservatively $2,000 per week which equals $104,000 per year net).

Yes, being self employed you'll have to smart with budgeting, and we don't apologize for that. Our leads are extremely effective and valuable, but we teach you to run a REAL BUSINESS. We aren't looking for the 9-5'ers that want to make 30-40k per year, and have everything spoon-fed to them. We want the aggressive closers, that have been dreaming of a very SIMPLE way to generate 100k+, closing deals a few days per week.



How the Leads works:

You are calling real people that have filled out a form, requesting insurance. THEY KNOW that they are filling out a request to BUY INSURANCE. Attached to this ad, is EXACTLY what we mail out every single week to new homeowners. Also, the attached picture of the state, shows you just how many LEFTOVER clients we have for the week, that filled out a form asking for coverage, and they have never received a call from us, simply because WE NEED MORE AGENTS.



Six Figure Sales Schedule:

We teach people to take 2, four-hour sessions of setting appointments (from home). And 2 full days of running appointments (in the client's home). You choose which county or counties you desire to work. That's it.



Don't have 25 hours a week to work?:

We'll look at what time you have available, and give you a realistic amount that you could make, if you hustle.



Am I capped out at 100k?

Definitely not. We teach people that you could make much more than that, but the smartest way to do it, is to hire and train others in the other 2 days you have availability in the week. Insurance companies pay MAJOR BONUSES to managers. And you don't have to stop selling while you do it. The average managers in our business makes $200,000+.

https://cleveland.craigslist.org/spa/d/hair-stylist-barber-for-booth/6340292907.html,Hair Stylist/Barber for Booth Rental in Independence,Independence,"We are currently seeking a Hair Stylist and/or Barber for an established, trendy salon in downtown Independence.  Since opening our doors in 2016, our prime location has resulted in a significant number of new relationships (walk-in customers)!

Commission vs. Booth Renting

Your success as a Beauty Professional or Barber depends a lot on your environment.  You want to practice your craft in a supportive environment that you enjoy, where you feel good about yourself, and where you can maximize your income.  This generally means either working for commission or renting a booth/chair.  

An increasingly popular method of working in a salon is renting a booth or chair, also called ""booth-renting"".  While salons that booth rent can be difficult to find (a result of the fact that the salon owner makes significantly less income than a traditional salon owner), they are extremely lucrative to the Stylist.  Renting a chair in a salon involves paying ""rent"" to the owner of the salon. It's no different than renting an apartment in an apartment building.  In this case, the salon owner leases out workstations to independent stylists in exchange for a monthly rent.  The rent is usually not more than the income you will earn from one or two services you perform that week.  That's right....for the cost of just one or two services per week, you can essentially run your own business and reap the rewards.  You get flexibility when scheduling your clients (you generally get a key to the salon and can schedule your clients whenever is convenient to you), and you also get to keep not only 100% of your income, but also 100% of any products you sell!!!!

The Pros of Booth Renting over working at a Commission-based Salon:

•  ***You are your own boss***. Your schedule accommodates you - not the salon manager.
•  ***You can charge whatever you like for the services you are providing***.
•  After paying your salon rental fee, all the money you earn is yours...including all income from product sales.

Generally, the only regret a booth-renting Stylist has is that they didn't make the move sooner!  The experienced cosmetologist with any type of client base will substantially increase his/her net income, while doing it on their own schedule.  It's a lot easier to change salons and run your own book of business if you have a list of clients who will follow you and keep you afloat.  Just make sure you aren't relocating too far from your existing salon....Anything less than 10 miles is usually the rule of thumb. 

Check us out online.  If you aren't convinced a booth rental scenario is right for you, reach out to one of our Stylists or Barbers that have recently made the change.  They are likely more than happy to give their wisdom on how the decision was the best decision they ever made!

READ CAREFULLY;

Amazing Job with VERY specific requirements.

PERSONAL ASSISTANT needed for a Real Estate Investing firm based in Lakewood, OH.

We are a progressive real estate investment company seeking a key representative. We are in the business of purchasing real estate in the Cleveland area. 

What's SPECIFICALLY needed from you..

(1) You MUST be a self-starter. This is a small organization that does a GREAT deal of business. There are AWESOME systems in place but you'll be figuring a bit out on your own. 

(2) You need to be TOTALLY comfortable with simple internet-based programs. Familiarity with Google (even google apps), online databases, etc. Also have an above-average grasp of Social Media (facebook, twitter, the like - PLEASE know what these are if applying )

(3) Our inbound calls from potential sellers has increased and need a great person to enhance our business. You will NOT be cold calling. Calls are generated to us from our various marketing campaigns and we need assistance taking their calls and turning them into qualified leads.

Candidates must possess the following skills:
• Great Team Player
• Ability to make 70 calls a day
• Must be organized
• Able to negotiate
• Must be upbeat and great nature
• Must have eloquent phone abilities
• Must be self-driven
• Must possess basic knowledge of Microsoft programs
• Ability to work well with others

(4) Be COMFORTABLE doing a small amount of PERSONAL ASSISTING. Since you'll be working DIRECTLY with me, at times I will need a few errands run. Pick up dry-cleaning, drop off FedEx, arrange for when the housekeeper comes by, etc.

(5) You'll be working out of a collaborative, open office environment with people who hustle and get things done. Think tech startup style energy and productivity.

OK - the COOL thing is that this is a pretty laid-back job where you get to interact with a lot of cool people. The WORK part of it is that sometimes there are DEADLINES and CRUNCHES and the schedule is intense then more laid back.

HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO NEXT.

Just to set your expectation, the last time I posted a job here I received over 300 applications and called TWO people back. I hired one of them immediately. So I will NOT be responding to all applications. Here's what I am looking for (see, this really CAN be easy!)

(1) Tell me how you will fit in THIS job! I've laid out as clearly as I can the job requirements. I know what I'm looking for and have made them a fit. I will NOT be calling you to clarify whether or not you're a fit. So there's no second chance - your response IS your impression!

(2) Tell me your income expectations (or a range). We'll be working together and I will be communicating VERY specific communications to you in the future. Being vague in this area just sets up a concern that you're not going to be able to ask for what you really want later if you come on board.

(3) Describe for me your ideal working environment. Hours, flexibility or structure, casual or formal. I'm kinda open to a number of options and inflexible on a few areas, but I want to know what works for you. I'm looking for the IDEAL fit, not to go through TRIAL runs...

(4) I'm glad to see your resume, but without an accompanying document (letter, rant, attachment, etc.) addressing the above, I can assure you that it will be a waste of your time.

IF YOU'VE READ THIS FAR!!!!
...brave soul!

Congratulations - you're possibly a fit for this pretty cool job. I love what I do and I'm looking for ONE person to help manage some things going forward. I'm much tamer than I sound but I do have very specific requirements which I communicate clearly then empower you to have the authority to enforce! You'll get to work with some quite renowned people (my clients) but the coolest part is our focus here on really improving our overall lives so a lot of focus and support will be given to that!

Get those responses over as soon as you can so the RIGHT one of you can start working right away. Reply to the email address at the top of this listing!",Per Posting Description,full-time

**Record which marketing category or contact method netted a particular sale. This will allow agent to evaluate how much time and money was spent prospecting to each category vs. how much commission income was generated from transaction in that category within specific period.

•Personal response. This type of call also requires a direct response, but is not as time critical. This might include potential customers who want to make an appointment or who have in-depth questions about the home selling process. Everyone who requests a personal response should receive one. The agent should, however, respond to these messages as quickly as time permits, by the close of business the same day, if possible. If for some reason the agent can not call back, the assistant can call back and cover for agent until the agent can make the call.
•Informational response. The assistant can handle this type of call, which typically includes basic questions about agent's services

https://cleveland.craigslist.org/wri/d/academic-consulting-firm/6345617738.html,Academic Consulting Firm Recruiting new Analysts and Editors,,"1.) Who we are:
We are a medium sized, cloud-based consultancy headquartered in Delaware, USA, but with consultants spread across the globe, from Asia to South America. We primarily handle Academic Consulting for Doctorate level clients, and are currently hiring for 3 positions: Qualitative Analyst, Quantitative Analyst, and Editor.
Each position is a strictly work-from-home position, and any applicant should view this as a strong incentive. Please note that hours for these positions are flexible, from part-time (10 hours per week) up to full-time (50-60 hours per week) depending on your schedule and preferences.
All applicants will be required to attempt a trial project which varies depending on the position they are applying for. All applicants to the SAME position will receive the SAME trial project - successful applicants will be paid for the trial project, but unsucessful applicants will NOT be paid. Please note for the trial project, and for all final deliverables, MS Word will be required.

2a.) Job responsibilities for the Qualitative Analyst position:
Your main responsibility will be to support our clients in their dissertation processes. This may include:

Content changes - Making changes to pre-existing work based on the comments of the client's dissertation committee.

Topic selection - Finding research gaps in academic literature, creating a valid problem statement, justifying the purpose for the study, and selecting an underlying Theoretical or Conceptual Framework
to guide the study. 

Expansions - Taking a preliminary piece of the client's work, and expanding it into complete chapters.

Methodological Development - Choosing the optimal qualitative methodology to use for a particular study, such as Grounded Theory, Content Analysis, or Phenomenology.

Qualitative Analysis - Coding qualitative data such as interviews or focus group transcripts, conducting the analysis using qualitative analysis software, and interpreting the results.

Literature Reviews - Finding and reviewing relevant recent literature, creating an outline and Annotated Bibliography for a literature review, and drafting the review based on the articles and outline.

Multi-part Projects - projects that involve elements of all of the above, and/or involve assisting our clients in correcting errors made in the above areas of their dissertation.

There will be substantial 'on the job learning' as you're slowly introduced to (and trained on) each of the above project types, one-by-one. It is very important for all applicants to the qualitative analyst position to be comfortable with researching academic literature via online databases such as Google Scholar or ERIC. This particular requirement is extremely important, perhaps even more so than the other requirements.

2b.) Job responsibilities for the Quantitative Analyst position:
Your main responsibility will be to support our clients in the statistical phases of their dissertation processes. 

Importantly, you will need to be comfortable designing and drafting a valid statistical methodology 
(specifying the sample, population, instruments, data collection and analysis procedures, etc.), 
running the analyses using standard stats packages, and drafting and interpreting the results. 

All deliverables need to be in a presentable, professional format, and should adhere to APA guidelines when applicable. Applicants must have a strong applied mathematics or statistics background; proficiency in applied statistics and hypothesis testing required.

Additionally, applicants must be familiar with common statistical software packages such as SPSS, R or Stata. As a bonus, applicants experienced in SEM and Path Analysis software like AMOS or MPLUS will receive higher pay for those project types.

Finally, all applicants must be extremely comfortable writing, as this is a big part of the position, not just statistical analysis and expertise, but academic writing.

2c.) Job responsibilities for the Editor position:
Your main responsibility will be to edit documents ranging from 25-200 pages, virtually all in APA 6 format, for both internal use and directly for clients. Almost all the documents will be academic papers (primarily dissertations), and familiarity with the dissertation formatting guidelines is required. 

Applicants must have a strong background in editing - we are not training editors: all editors should apply ready to immediately begin work. Applicants should be familiar with all functions of MS Word, and specifically be very comfortable with APA 6 formatting guidelines as applicable to documents in MS Word format. Additionally, applicants should be fully knowledgeable of all the major formatting guidelines of a standard doctorate level dissertation, including headings, front matter, references, etc.

3.) Requirements:
Applicants must possess a meticulous nature and an extremely high attention to detail.

Excellent command of the English Language.

Bachelor's Degree or higher, preferably from a good American university. However, most of our analysts have graduate degrees.

4.) Compensation:
a.) Qualitative Analyst fees vary by project type and complexity. Typically, it ranges from $200-$600 per project depending on length, difficulty, and timeline. Most of our analysts make between $1000-$2000 monthly on limited, flexible hours. However, several full-time analysts make substantially more, depending on how quickly and efficiently they can do the work, as well as their experience and seniority at the firm.

b.) Quantitative Analyst fees vary depending on whether the work is primarily done in SPSS, or if it requires other software like SAS, STATA, R, AMOS, MPLUS etc. In the former case, fees range from $100-$300, and in the latter case, fees range from $300-$900. More advanced software is typically required if the project is large and/or complex, requiring more sophisticated statistical methodologies. We do not provide any of the software, and all applicants must have access to their own software to be considered.

c.) Pay for editors is $1/page for 'internal' work done on company documents, and $1.5/page for 'external' work done on client documents. A typical edit will be between 25-200 pages, and will pay $1.5/page assuming it is being done for a client.

5.) To Apply:
Please reply with a recently updated resume, and a cover letter or email explaining your interest in the specified position: Qualitative Analyst, Quantitative Analyst, or Editor.",Please refer to the compensation section of the job ad,contract

Company Overview
Blackhawk Transport was founded in 1990 with one R model Mac and three Raven flat bed trailers. As a Hendricks Holding Company Blackhawk Transport has continued to grow through customer expansion as well as acquisition. Today, we run a mix of company trucks and Owner/Operator trucks. Our fleet is comprised of Vans, Flatbeds and Conestogas available throughout the US and Canada. 
We are not your regular freight management company. Typically, any company can move products or packages from Point A to Point B, but what really matters is the manner in which the order is taken, the attention to detail as the load is being moved, and the on-time, courteous delivery of the cargo. It's our employees who make the difference--from the receptionists, to our dispatchers ... everyone knows the crucial roles they play in making Blackhawk a successful dedicated transportation services and logistics business.
